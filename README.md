# Passport Authentication - Tutorial Followed

## Description

For this project, I followed along with Traversy Media's Node.js With Passport Authentication tutorial on Youtube. While the project is not my own creation, the tutorials helped me hone some of the skills that I have been learning in my coding bootcamp up to this point â€” specifically regarding Express.js, Passport, User Authentication, and EJS Layouts.

## Areas of Focus

- Passport (User Authentication)
- EJS (Template Engine)
- Node.js
- Express
